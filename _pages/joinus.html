<h4>Multiple PhD and Msc Openings (2025 Fall)</h4> 

<hr>

<p>The TAI Lab has multiple openings for PhD and Msc (Master of Science in Computing Science) positions starting from 2025 Fall.
Both PhD and Msc programs are thesis-based and hosted by the School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University. Detail information (including requirements, application process, and graduation requirements) about both programs are available <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/study/future-graduates/programs/computing-science.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Why TAI Lab @ SFU?</b> The TAI Lab is a leading research lab in trustworthy AI research in the greater Vancouver area and in Canada. The TAI Lab actively publishes at renowned conferences in machine learning and computer security. Several research outcomes have gained a profound research impact and have been widely applied in both industry and academia. We have close connections and collaborations in academia and industry worldwide. Further, SFU is a leading research university in Canada and North America, ranked as Top 4 in Canada and Top 40 in North America according to both <a href="https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&northamerica" target="_blank">CSRankings</a> and <a href="https://www.airankings.org/" target="_blank">AIRankings</a>.</p>

<p>The TAI Lab is abundant in funding and computing resources, with several dedicated GPU workstations and cloud credits. We fund PhD and Msc students according to the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/computing/current-students/graduates/financial-support-scholarships.html" target="_blank">school guideline</a> upon satisfactory performance. At TAI Lab, we aim to grow students into independent and respected researchers in trustworthy AI. To this end, we teach skills on conducting scientific research, suggest topics according to student's expertises and preferences, cultivate a thriving, inclusive, and relaxed research environment, work together for impactful research, and generously support students' future career.</p>

<p>For international students of concern, we do not need GRE scores but only TOEFL or IELTS scores; we are flexible in terms of enrollment deferral in light of visa delays; Canada has a low geopolitical risk and friendly environment for international residents - applying for visa only once, then international travel throughout the program duration without visa restrictions; and the beautiful Vancouver is a perfect place to live.</p>

<p><b>Who are we looking for?</b> The applicants should satisfy our university-level and school-level requirements for <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/study/future-graduates/programs/phd-computing.html">PhD</a> and <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/fas/study/future-graduates/programs/master-science-thesis.html">Msc</a> applicants. <b>Specifically, our lab prioritizes PhD recruitment over Msc, and we do not require PhD applicants to have a Master degree</b>. We look for applicants who are ((excellent in computer science & AI courses) or (outstanding in research experience & skills)) and have a strong motivation in conducting leading trustworthy AI research.</p>

<p>We aim to build an equal, diverse, and inclusive culture for all lab members. Students from underrepresented groups (in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, or more) are especially welcome to join our lab!</p>
